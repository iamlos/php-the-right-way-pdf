## Overview

This is a simple (2-3 line) script to generate a printer/ebook-reader\* friendly  
version of <http://phptherightway.com>.  
  
You need to have Jekyll, pandoc, MacTex (or at least pdflatex for PDF output)  

## NOTICE  

This currently only outputs in PDF format. You may choose to skip this mess and  
download the PDF or single HTML version of the site also included right here.  
  
The PDF conversion required MacTex.pkg which was 2.3 GB and 4.33 GB decompressed.  

If you need an updated version of the PDF without going through the hassle of setting  
anything up, just send me a message and I will regenerate the PDF.  

**Even better, send me a cronjob that updates the PDF nightly**

*Thanks! -Isam Machlovi*
